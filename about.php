                <h1> About Headline Analytics </h1>
				Headline Analytics is a simple web-app that routinely fetches data from Indonesia online medias, takes the headlines of the news, and analyzes it to find interesting trends!
				<br>
				As of <b>version 0.3</b>, this web-app now also fetches data from some <b><u>international media</u></b>!
				<br><br>
				This project was started on April 8th, 2016 and is planned to be a submission for Indonesia Microsoft Student Partner program.
